# ConfApp
VOICE- A conference application for handling q/a sessions

This app will allow conference attendees to ask questions directly to the lecturer using their smartphones. Users can submit questions easily by typing or recording their voice. The app will use Python's speech and text recognition to accurately understand the questions. These questions will be sent to a server for storage and organization using a Firestore database. This server will make sure that all questions are kept securely and can be accessed by the lecturer at any time. To make it convenient for users, an Android app will be developed with a simple interface. Users can record their questions or type them in the app, which will send them to the server for processing. Our goal is to create a learning environment where everyone can participate and have their questions answered, regardless of communication barriers or time limitations.
